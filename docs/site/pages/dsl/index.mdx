# TSX/JSX Content Authoring (Player DSL)

While Player content _can_ be written directly in JSON, it's definitely not the preferable authoring format. To take advantage of existing developer tool-chains, Player provides a mechanism for authoring content in (J/T)SX as React components and simple TypeScript objects. The Player CLI can then be used to transpile the React tree into a JSON content.

## Writing DSL Content

In order to use the DSL to write content, your plugin library should ship a DSL component package. These will define the primitive _components_ to use to build up the tree. Authorship of these components is covered in the [Writing DSL Components](../assets/dsl) secton. The Player Reference Assets ship their own DSL Components via the `@player-ui/reference-assets-components` pacakge.

In the examples below, we will use the Player Reference Assets Components.

### Basic Setup 

To get started, you'll need the following dependencies in your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@player-tools/dsl": "0.4.1",
    "@player-tools/cli": "0.4.1",
    "@player-ui/reference-assets-components": "0.6.0",
    "@types/react": "17.0.39",
    "react": "17.0.2"
}
```

Next, you'll need to configure your environment for DSL Compilation and JSON validation. Below is a basic configuration that can be added in your `package.json`. For a more detailed explination and examples on further customization please refer to the [CLI](../tools/cli) section. 

```json
"player": {
    "dsl": {
      "src": "./src/main/tsx",
      "outDir": "./out"
    },
    "json": {
      "src": "./out/*.json"
    },
  }
```

### Basic Format and File Layout

By default, all files that contain a Player Flow should be exported as a `.tsx` file and the schema should be in a `.ts` file. For how to change this behavior, please refer to the [DSL Plugins](./plugins) section of the docs. Each of these files should contain a default export of their appropriate object. For example a file that exports a flow should look like the following:

```tsx
export default {
    id: 'my-flow',
    views: [....],
    navigation: {....}
}
```

and a file that exports the schema should look like: 

```typescript
const mySchema = {...}

export default mySchema

```

### Navigation

At this time the `navigation` section is a basic JS object. The `@player-ui/types` package provides typescript typings for this.

```tsx
import { Navigation } from '@player-ui/types';

const navigation: Navigation = {
  BEGIN: 'Start',
  Start: {
    startState: 'VIEW_1',
    VIEW_1: {
      state_type: 'VIEW',
      ref: 'view-1',
      transitions: {
        '*': 'END_Done',
      },
    },
    END_Done: {
      state_type: 'END',
      outcome: 'done',
    },
  },
};
```

One convenience feature is the auto injection of the the `ref` proeprty for a `VIEW` type state if the corresponding view is a React tree. 

```tsx
import { Navigation } from '@player-ui/types';

const view = (
  <Collection id="my-view">
    <Text>Some value</Text>
    <Input>
      <Input.Label>Some label</Input.Label>
    </Input>
  </Collection>
);

const navigation: Navigation = {
  BEGIN: 'Start',
  Start: {
    startState: 'VIEW_1',
    VIEW_1: {
      state_type: 'VIEW',
      ref: view,
      transitions: {
        '*': 'END_Done',
      },
    },
    END_Done: {
      state_type: 'END',
      outcome: 'done',
    },
  },
};
```
### Bindings and Expressions

Both `binding` and `expression` in the JSX authoring leverages a tagged template, typically abbreviated as `b` and `e` respectively. In a similar fashion to using `css` or `graphql` in a JS file, this enables syntax-highlighting and validation of bindings and expressions within a JS file.

To create a binding, or expression:

```tsx
import { binding as b, expression as e } from '@player-tools/dsl';

const myBinding = b`foo.bar`;
const myExpression = e`foo()`;
```

The binding and expression instances can also automatically dereference themselves when used inside of another string:

```tsx
const stringWithBinding = `Some text: ${myBinding}`; // 'Some text: {{foo.bar}}'
const stringWithExp = `Some expr: ${myExpression}`; // 'Some expr: @[foo()]@'
```

### View

Please refer to the [Views](./views) section for a detailed overview of how to write DSL Views

### Schema

Please refer to the [Schema](./schema) section for a detailed overview of how to write DSL Schemas

## Compiling DSL Content

Once your DSL content is authored, you can use the Player CLI to compile and validate your content. For documentation on this functionality, please refer to the [Player CLI](../tools/cli) section
