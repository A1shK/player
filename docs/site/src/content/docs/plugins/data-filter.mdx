# Data Filter Plugin

The `data-filter-plugin` enables users to filter out segments of the data-model during serialization.

## Usage

<PlatformTabs>
  <core>

Add the plugin to Player and configure the exclusion paths:

```ts
import { Player } from '@player-ui/player';
import { DataFilterPlugin } from '@player-ui/data-filter-plugin';

const player = new Player({
  plugins: [
    new DataFilterPlugin({
      paths: ['local', 'constants'],
    }),
  ],
});
```

This will exclude any top-level `local` or `constants` paths in the data-model from appearing in the serialized response.

  </core>
