Player is a framework for building cross-platform experiences. The main engine is written in Typescript, with platform specific adapters for iOS, Android, and React (web). It's built from the ground up with plugins in mind to perfectly tailor the experience specifically for your app.

This storybook focuses on some example of using the React Player library, including some of the underlying plugins and references for building out apps using Player.
