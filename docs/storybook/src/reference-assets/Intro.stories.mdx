# Reference Assets

The assets in this section serve as an example and base for building out a plugin to provide a full fledged asset support for an application.

## Usage

To import and use these assets in your app, simply import the plugin and attach it to Player:

```tsx
import { useWebPlayer, WebPlayerPlugin } from '@player-ui/react';
import ReferenceAssetsPlugin from '@player-ui/reference-assets-plugin-react';

const plugins: Array<WebPlayerPlugin> = [new ReferenceAssetsPlugin()];

export const App = () => {
  // Create Player with our plugins
  const { webPlayer } = useWebPlayer({ plugins });

  // Start the flow.

  React.useEffect(() => {
    webPlayer.start(/** Insert your player content */);
  }, []);

  // Render Player
  return <webPlayer.Component />;
};
```
